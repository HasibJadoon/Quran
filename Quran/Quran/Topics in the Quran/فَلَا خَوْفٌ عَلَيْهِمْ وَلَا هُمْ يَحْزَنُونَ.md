Fadal saleh, 2 years bothering this Ayah
لا يحافون ولا يحزنون 
Fear is constant, humanity is always subject to fear. 
Sadness comes and go. The future is associated with past
على  there is no fear on them kid example snake, uncle heading to beach 
So feel afraid, but there will be no danger for them
لا عليهم خوف ، It isn't they who have fear over them ... other do  
لا خوفٌ عليهم 
There is no fear over them
I wasn't the only one sleeping in the class.

لا خوفَ عليهم 
ولا حزن عليهم 
 Grief is that one who is feeling himself
 ولا حزن عليهم
 Means some else is sad for you, doesn't make sense
 They are afraid of danger but it will never be manifested.
