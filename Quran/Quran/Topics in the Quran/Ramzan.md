Month of ramzan is which the quran was sent down in as guidance for people and  as clear evidence giving guidance and as distinguishing between  right and wrong. 
Therefore, whoever witnesses the month    the he should fast it and whoever have been a patient or had been on a journey then a number from other days. Allah wants ease for you and he doesn't want hardship for you, and that you complete the count and declare Allah's  greatness  based on him having guided [^4] you .So that you will be greatful 

[^1]: بكم instead of لكم gave the flavour of both meaning for you and by you. And also explicitly saying don't want hardship for you, showing Allah care towards us to make ease for and remove hardship. However, we can get hardship along with ease,
- I want you to be good and I don't want you to be bad
